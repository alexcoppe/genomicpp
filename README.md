# genomiC++ :dna:
A bunch of C++ programs for working with bioinformatics files. It uses only the standard libraries of C++ and it's in continuos alpha version as I create and iprove the difereent programs when needed.

Its compilation and functionality have been verified on the following operating system:

- macOS :green_apple:
- Linux :penguin:


# Download and Compilation :floppy_disk:

```console
>>> git clone https://github.com/alexcoppe/genomicpp.git
>>> cd genomicpp
>>> make
```

After compilation, move the generated executables to a directory listed in the $PATH variable. You can identify these directories by using the ```echo $PATH``` command.

## vcf_to_table

This software transforms an uncompressed VCF file to a tab-separated values (tsv) file. It also operates with VCFs generated by [SnpEff](https://pcingola.github.io/SnpEff/) and [ANNOVAR](https://annovar.openbioinformatics.org/en/latest/). To run it, you need two arguments: the VCF file and a text file specifying the desired fields. Refer to the table below for guidance on creating this file.

When utilizing a [SnpEff](https://pcingola.github.io/SnpEff/) annotated VCF, the tool currently displays all the transcripts indicated by SnpEff.

Starting character | What you get
------------ | -------------
None | get the fields from the VCF
 : | get a subfield from the INFO field added by SnpEff
 ; | get a specific subfiled from the IMFO field 
 \| | get a specific subfield from the Genotype fields 

Currently, the software operates exclusively on 1 or 2 genotype fields.

Example of a text file specifying the desired fields and subfields:

```console
:hgvs_c
position
;gnomAD_genome_AMR
|AD
```

Launching the program with the above text file

```console
vcf_to_table a_vcf_file_path.vcf wanted_fields.txt
```

Output:

```console
n.-3702C>T      157370625       0.0020  14,1    31,5
n.*1931C>T      157370625       0.0020  14,1    31,5
n.-3707C>T      157370630       0       15,1    33,4
...
```


## get_pass_variants

This program filters a VCF file annotated by [SnpEff](https://pcingola.github.io/SnpEff/), retaining only the variants marked as 'PASS' in the FILTER field.

Option | What does it do
------------ | -------------
-h | Show help

##### Example

```console
>>> get_pass_variants /path_to_vcf_file/variants.vcf
```
